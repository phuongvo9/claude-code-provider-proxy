‚è∫ The BIG_MODEL_NAME and SMALL_MODEL_NAME environment variables are used to configure the proxy to select different models for processing requests.
  - BIG_MODEL_NAME: This is used for more complex or nuanced tasks that require a powerful model. In the provided .env example, google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview is specified. This model is likely chosen for its advanced capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, making it suitable for tasks that demand high accuracy and
  sophistication.
  - SMALL_MODEL_NAME: This is used for simpler or more frequent tasks where speed and cost-efficiency are prioritized. The example specifies google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001. This model is likely chosen for its faster processing times and lower operational costs, making it ideal for tasks like token counting or straightforward
  request/response translations.

  Best Advice for Configuration:

  1. Align with Claude Model Tiers: Map BIG_MODEL_NAME to a model that mirrors Claude's Opus tier (high performance, advanced capabilities) and SMALL_MODEL_NAME to a model that mirrors Claude's Haiku tier (fast, cost-effective).
  2. Consider Your Project's Needs: If your proxy primarily handles complex tasks, prioritize a powerful BIG_MODEL_NAME. If it handles many simple requests, optimize for a fast SMALL_MODEL_NAME.
  3. Test Performance and Cost: Experiment with different models available through your provider (like OpenRouter) to find the best balance of performance, cost, and accuracy for your specific use case.
  4. Stay Updated: Model landscapes evolve rapidly. Keep an eye on new model releases and benchmarks to ensure you're using the most effective options.
